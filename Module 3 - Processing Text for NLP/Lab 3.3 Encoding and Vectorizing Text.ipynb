    "# Lab 3.3: Encoding and Vectorizing Text\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will examine the bag-of-words (BOW) method to convert text data into numerical values. These numerical values will be used later for predictions with machine learning (ML) algorithms. You will then use the Word2Vec algorithm that's implemented by the built-in Amazon SageMaker algorithm BlazingText, which generates vectors from the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert text data to vectors of numbers, a vocabulary of known words (_tokens_) is extracted from the text. Then, the occurence of words is scored. Finally, the resulting numerical values are saved in vocabulary-long vectors. There are a few versions of BOW, which correspond to different methods of scoring words. In this lab, you will use the scikit-learn (sklearn) library to calculate the numerical values for BOW.\n",

    "In Amazon SageMaker, BlazingText is similar to the original implementation of [Word2vec](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf). BlazingText provides an efficient implementation of the continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) and Skip-gram architectures by using negative sampling. It runs on CPUs and, additionally, on GPUs. The GPU implementation uses highly optimized CUDA kernels. To learn more, refer to [*BlazingText: Scaling and Accelerating Word2Vec using Multiple GPUs*](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3146347.3146354). BlazingText also supports the learning of subword embeddings with CBOW and Skip-gram modes. This feature enables BlazingText to generate vectors for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, as demonstrated in this [Amazon SageMaker Examples notebook](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/blazingtext_word2vec_subwords_text8/blazingtext_word2vec_subwords_text8.ipynb).\n",

This mode enables distributed Word2vec training across multiple CPU nodes, which means that Word2vec computation can experience an almost linear scale-up to process hundreds of millions of words per second. To learn more, refer to [*Parallelizing Word2Vec in Shared and Distributed Memory*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.04661.pdf)."
